1. Install the BIND package.  
   - Example: `sudo yum install bind bind-utils`  
     Installs the BIND DNS server and related utilities.  

2. Configure the main BIND configuration file.  
   - Example: `sudo nano /etc/named.conf`  
     Edit the main configuration file to define zones, access controls, and other settings.  

   - Key changes:  
     ```  
     options {
         listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; any; }; # Listen on all interfaces.
         allow-query     { any; };              # Allow DNS queries from any source.
     };

     zone "example.com" {
         type master;
         file "/var/named/example.com.zone";
     };
     ```  

3. Create a zone file for your domain.  
   - Example: `sudo nano /var/named/example.com.zone`  
     Create the DNS zone file with the necessary records.  

   - Sample zone file:  
     ```  
     $TTL 86400
     @   IN  SOA     ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                 2025012301 ; Serial
                 3600       ; Refresh
                 1800       ; Retry
                 604800     ; Expire
                 86400 )    ; Minimum TTL

         IN  NS      ns1.example.com.
         IN  A       192.168.1.100
     ns1 IN  A       192.168.1.100
     www IN  A       192.168.1.101
     ```  

4. Adjust permissions for the zone file.  
   - Example: `sudo chown root:named /var/named/example.com.zone`  
     Ensures that the named service can read the zone file.  

5. Enable and start the `named.service`.  
   - Example:  
     ```  
     sudo systemctl enable named
     sudo systemctl start named
     ```  
     Enables the BIND service at startup and starts it immediately.  

6. Configure the firewall to allow DNS traffic.  
   - Example:  
     ```  
     sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=dns
     sudo firewall-cmd --reload
     ```  
     Opens port 53 for DNS traffic in the firewall.  

7. Verify that the DNS service is running.  
   - Example: `sudo systemctl status named`  
     Checks if the named service is active and running.  

8. Test the DNS resolution.  
   - Example: `dig @localhost example.com`  
     Tests if the DNS server resolves the domain "example.com" correctly.  

9. Update the server's resolver configuration (optional).  
   - Example: `sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf`  
     Add the server's IP to the resolver configuration:  
     ```  
     nameserver 192.168.1.100  
     ```  

10. Restart the named service after any configuration changes.  
    - Example: `sudo systemctl restart named`  
      Applies the updated settings by restarting the service.
